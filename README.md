# spatial_transcriptomics_328

Project 328 is a spatial transcriptomics project in collaboration with Dr. Katharina Botterman. It includes a 10x Genomics Visium data set of murine hearts, 1 sham and 1 ischemia reperfusion (I/R) 24 h after injury.
This respository is meant to track the changes of project 328's R scripts only. No data or results should be added.
